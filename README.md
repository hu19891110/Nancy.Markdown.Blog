A Blog engine that uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [NancyFx](http://NancyFx.org)

Nancy.Blog can integrate with exsiting sites. It's relatively unopinionated about views, paging, etc.

See the Example project for some ideas on how to use it.

  [PHP Markdown Extras](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) (similar to GitHub extras)
